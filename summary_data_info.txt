The columns selected for the summary_data.txt file came data as explained in the file features_info.txt.

From the 561 features in the file features.txt, all those containing “mean” and “std” (for standard deviation) were extracted. Two new columns “subject” and “activity” were added to represent the 30 subjects and the 6 activities respectively used in the study.

Below is the list of columns that define the columns in the file summary_data.txt
The summary_data.txt contains data sorted by activity and then subject for the mean of 79 variables in the data.

activity
Has 6 values representing activity performed by the subjects in the study
WALKING
WALKING_UPSTAIRS
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
SITTING
STANDING
LAYING

subject
Values are 1-30 to represent all the subjects that were used in training and test data


features
There are 79 columns representing either the mean or the standard deviation of the vector selected

tBodyAcc- XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

For each of these vectors
mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean


There is a separate name for each of the X,Y and Z axis vectors combined with either mean or standard deviation

For example tBodyAcc.mean.X is the mean of tBodyAcc-X

The data contains the mean of each variable grouped by activity and subjected. There are therefore 6x30 = 180 rows in summary_data and 81 columns ( activity, subject and 79 variables for the means&std of the various vectors.
